Create a database called 'my_first_db'. 
     //use 02_testDB
     //switched to db 02_testDB

Create students collection. 
    //db.createCollection("students")

Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: 
({name: STRING, 
    home_state: STRING, 
    lucky_number: NUMBER, 
    birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}}) 

    //db.students.insert({name: "Steve Francis", home_state: "Maryland", lucky_number: 3, birthday: {month: 02, day: 21, year: 1977}})
    
Create 5 students with the appropriate info. 
    //'' x 5
Get all students. 
    //db.students.find().pretty()

Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo). 
    //db.students.find({home_state: "Florida"}).pretty()

Get all students whose lucky number is: 
    greater than 10
        //db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 10}}).pretty()

    less than or equal to 10 
        //db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}}).pretty()

    between 0 and 11 (inclusive)
        //db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 11, $gte: 0}}).pretty()

 Add a field to each student collection called 'teams' that is an ARRAY.  
 It should contain some entries: . 
 Do this in ONE operation. 
        //db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {team: ["Houston"]}})

 Add some unique team for each particular students into each of their interest arrays. 
        //db.students.update({name: "Tracy McGrady"}, {$push: {team: "Orlando"}})
